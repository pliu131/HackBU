# THERE IS MISSING CONTENT HERE. Stupid StackEdit didn't save my changes
# HTML Text, Lists, and Images
---
Most of the web is text.
---
## Level 1-6 Headers
---
h1 is used for main headings, h2-h6 for subheadings
---
    <h1>This is a Level 1 Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
    <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
    <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
---
## Paragraphs
---
Primarily used for body text.
---
    <p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet frankfurter short loin brisket, pork chop leberkas short ribs 
  swine t-bone bresaola beef venison salami boudin corned beef.</p>
---
## Bold, Italic, Strong, and Emphasis
---
Semantic VS Structural
---
By default, strong and bold look the same, and italics and em look the same. 
---
They are inline elements.
---
    <p><b>Beef ribs</b> pastrami chicken prosciutto, 
    short ribs meatloaf hamburger sausage chuck 
    short loin salami ribeye beef ground round.</p>
---
    <p>Turducken beef ribs short loin spare 
    ribs leberkas swine frankfurter 
    <i>hamburger</i> kielbasa pancetta.</p>
---
    <p><strong>Beef ribs</strong> pastrami chicken prosciutto, 
    short ribs meatloaf hamburger sausage chuck 
    short loin salami ribeye beef ground round.</p>
---
    <p>Turducken beef ribs short loin spare 
    ribs leberkas swine frankfurter 
    <em>hamburger</em> kielbasa pancetta.</p>
---
## Superscript and Subscript
---
For all the mathematicians and chemists.
---
  <p>My birthday is January 31<sup>st</sup>, 1993</p>
--- 
  <p>Vitamin water is essentially just
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></p>
---
## Line Breaks and Horizontal Rule 
---
These push the content afterwards onto a new line. These are empty elements.
---
  <p>Would you please<br /> just let me<br /> 
  finish this sentence<br> on one line?</p>
---  
    <p>I don't like the sentence below me.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>What is that line doing there?</p>
---
## Whitespace Collapsing
---
Unless you specify, simply pressing enter on a line will not create a new line on the web page. 
---
In addition, any amount of spaces will simply show a single space. This is known as whitespace collapsing.
---
    <p>This is an example of whitespace collapsing</p>
    <p>This       is an example of whitespace collapsing</p>
    <p>This is an           example of whitespace collapsing</p>
    <p>This is an example of           whitespace 
    collapsing</p>
---
## Quotations
---
Blockquotes are block elements (as you can assume), and regular quotes are inline items, like strong and em.
---
    <blockquote>
    <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. 
    That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make 
    shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're 
    going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television 
    programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
    </blockquote>
---
  <p>Samuel L. Jackson said <q>English, mother! Do you speak it?!<q></p>
---
## Abbreviations and Acronyms 
---
These must contain a title attribute. What is contained in these attributes will be shown in a tooltip when you hover over the element.
---
    <p><abbr title="Hyper-text markup language">HTML</abbr>
    is a term you all should be familiar with by now.</p>
    <p><abbr title="Doctor">Doc.</abbr>, <abbr title="professor">Prof.</abbr>, 
    and <abbr title="mister">MR.</abbr> should also be familiar to you.</p> 
---
## Citations and Definitions
---
Citations are used for sources that you are not your own.
---
  <p><cite>Flowers for Algernon</cite> was a book I read 
  last semester for English. It was really good.</p>
---
Definitions are used for important terms.
---
  <p><dfn>HTML</dfn> is a term you should definitely be able to 
  define by now. So is <dfn>CSS</dfn>.</p>
---
## Addresses
---
Simply contain information about your address and contact information. 
---
This is an example of semantic markup.
---
    <address>
      <p><a href="mailto:pliu7@binghamton.edu">pliu7@binghamton.edu</a></p>
      <p>20 Hawley Street</p>
      <p>Binghamton, NY 13901</p>
    </address>
---
## Changes to Content
---
Deletions, Insertions, and Strikethroughs
---
You can bring to notice changes in your content, like awesome price cuts 
---
or mistakes you made.
---
    <p>My favorite fruits are <del>apples</del> <ins>bananas</ins>!</p>
    <p>The price of the Moto X: <br />
      <s>was $499</s><br />
      now $349!
    </p>
---
# Lists!
---
Lists are comprised of two types of elements
---
The list itself and the list items with in the list. 
---
When you enclose list items within a list, they will automatically format. 
---
You can also nest other types of elements within a list, like paragraphs or headers.
---
## Ordered Lists 
---
As the name suggests, lists all of its items in numerical order.
---
    <p>These are a few of my favorite things (ranked from most favorite to least favorite):
    <ol>
      <li>Bubble baths</li>
      <li>Teaching web development</li>
      <li>Picking things up and putting them down</li>
      <li>Espresso</li>
      <li>Oxford shirts from Uniqlo</li>
    </ol>
---
## Unordered Lists
---
These lists simply add a bullet next to each item.
---
    <p>Shopping List</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spinach</li>
      <li>Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>Five <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of chicken breast</li>
      <li>Whole Wheat Pasta</li>
      <li>Beer from Wegman's</li>
    </ul>
---
## Definition Lists
---
These are used for definitions, and are a bit different from normal lists.
---
Each definition should contain a definition term and a definition definition 
---
Yes, that is what we will call it.
---
These element should be adjacent to each other.
---

    </dl>
---
## Nested Lists
---
You can put lists inside of lists! Listception!
---
    <p>List of Movies Where Leonardo DiCaprio:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Is arrested for fraud:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Wolf of Wall Street</li>
          <li>Catch Me If You Can</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finds himself in the ocean:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inception</li>
          <li>Titanic</li>
          </ol>
       </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plays essentially the same character:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inception</li>
          <li>Shutter Island</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
---
## Links
---
Links are specified by the "a" or the "anchor" tags. 
---
Each has an attribute called href, or hyperlink reference, which refers to the URL, or the Universal Resource Locator, it will go to when clicked. 
---
There are two types of URLs: one is a relative URL and one is an absolute URL. Here are some examples.
---
    <a href="index.html">This is a link to the homepage.</a>
    <a href="about/contact.html">This is a link to the contact page. It is within a folder in the root directory called "about".</a>
    <a href="../other.html">This is a link to another page that is in a folder before the present working directory.</a>
---
This is a relative URL. It points to a webpage relative to the page we are currently on. 
---
Thought of in a different way, it refers to a page in the same directory that we are working in.
---
There are also absolute URLs. 
---
    <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>
    <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
---
These refer to the domain name of IP address of the web site you are looking for, and can point to them from anywhere, even if it is not a web page relative to the one you are currently on.
---
Note that these links are prefixed with "https://". HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and the S simply means that it is secure. We will talk about this later, but this just lets the browser know that we should use a certain protocol when trying to get web pages.
---
## Images
---
Images are embedded into web pages very similar to the way that links/anchor tags. 
---
They must have a src attribute that points to the location of the image.
---
"src" attributes, like "href" attributes, can point to resources relative or absolute.
---
The title attribute is shown when a mouse hovers over the image.
---
The alt attribute is read outloud when the client is visually impaired.
---
For example, this photo uses an image that is not stored in the present working directory. 
---
    <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/300/300" alt="An adorable little kitten" title="Cute kitten" />
---
This example, on the other hand, uses an image that is stored in the images folder of the root directory.
---
    <img src="images/kitten.jpg" alt="An adorable little kitten" title="Cute kitten" />
---
### HTML5 Figure
---
HTML5 introduced a new element, called a figure. 
---
This was made to group images and related content, like image captions, together in one element. 
---
The figure tag wraps all of the content. You use a regular img tag for the actual image, and you add a caption to the image using a figcaption element.
---
    <figure>
        <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/300/300" alt="An adorable little kitten" title="Cute kitten" /><br>
        <figcaption>This is an adorable little kitten.</figcaption>
    </figure>
---
## Grouping Related Elements Together
---
### Divs and Spans
---
Divs are used to group text and elements inside a block. For this example, we are using it for a navigation menu.
---
    <div id="header">
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
---
Spans are used to group text and elements within an inline element. For example, if you wanted to add a class attribute to the title of a book.
---
    <p>I really liked reading that one book, <span class="title">To Kill a Mockingbird</span></p>
---
Now that we've learned about these elements, we will use them for your own personal benefit
---
...not in an evil way.
