# Learning Ruby Resources!
========================= 
Here are some really awesome resources for learning Ruby, the language of the Rails framework we will be using in class to build web applications. Most of these are tutorials and readings I have personally used to learn programming. 

For those of you who have no programming experience, Ruby is an incredibly easy programming language to understand because of its human-like syntax, but you will have the begin to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming, as everything in Ruby is an Object (more about this later). 

For the others who do have prior programming experience, whether it be that you are a CS major or have taken a programming class before, you will be kicking yourself for not knowing this language existed before.

I do recommend you install Ruby on your computer and just work in the console. Here are the links to do that:
[Linux/Unix/Mac OS](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) 
[Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)

However, you can always use this nifty in-browser tool called [repl.it](http://repl.it/). However, we plan on using Ruby 2.0.0 for the semester, so some newer syntax may not work properly.

I will warn those that use a Windows machine for this class will run into some problems, so I recommend either running a virtual machine with Linux or doing a dual install of Linux, both of which I will gladly help you with if you don't understand. But here are some links for that as well:
[Install on Virtual Box](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox)
[Dual Boot Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot)

# Free Resources!

## Quick Reads
I call these quick reads because they provide more of an overview of the language rather than a deeper understanding of it.
[Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
[Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html)

## Beginner
[Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)
Who knew programming could be so entertaining? Follow along with these cartoons and lessons. I guarantee it will be more fun than any CS class you've ever taken.
(P.S. If you liked that, check out [_why's post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-post-modern-genius/) on Smashing Magazine.)

[Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/) 
This is a great place to get started as the lessons are interactive. If you were to do the absolute minimum (which you should not because you are a fantastic person and can do so much more than that), I would recommend Ruby Primer and Ruby Primer: Ascent.

[Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
This is a course by the folks at CodeSchool. If you like this course and the other free courses at CodeSchool (which you should definitely check out), a full subscription for their website is only $29/month. (Use my referral code!)

## Intermediate
[Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
For those of you who enjoy learning things more comprehensively (and perhaps a little bit masochistic?), this will be the right resource for you. This will give you some practice coding in the command line if you have not been.

[Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
Once you have everything set up locally on your machine, take the challenge of the Ruby Koans! Please read the README that comes with the files. If you do run into any problems settings this up, please feel free to ask for help.

## Advanced
[Metaprogramming](http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/15/metaprogramming-in-ruby-its-all-about-the-self/)
This is a blog post on Metaprogramming in Ruby. 

[Functional Programming](http://www.sitepoint.com/series/functional-programming-techniques-with-ruby/)
It allows you to write awesome DSLs (domain-specific languages). If you are also interested in more design-related readings, [Sitepoint](http://sitepoint.com) is an awesome blog to follow.

[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
Ruby is a beautiful language. Here's how you keep it looking as pretty as it does. For a more comprehensive version, check [this](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) out.

[Ruby Newcomers Guide](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/Newcomers/ruby.html)
Just some additional info that you'll find useful.

[Objects in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4967556/ruby-craziness-class-vs-object)
If anyone is a little bit confused about Objects in Ruby, this Stack Overflow post should help you out.

## Other Stuff
[RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/)
Ruby Gems are packages of Ruby code that extend or modify functionality in your Ruby applications. We will be using gems extensively in Rails, so it is a good idea to get an understanding of what they are.

[Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
This is the text editor that I recommend using for this class and it is very accessible to beginners. However, if you are a hardcore Vim/Emacs/whatever user, feel free to use that.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
Although not directly linked to Ruby, Git is a tool we will be using with Rails to take care of version control.

# Books! 
You can find most of these in the library, but if you can't, they are worth the buy.
